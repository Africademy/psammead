## Description

Psammead Image Placeholder is a `div` with a base-64 encoded SVG background image that depicts the BBC logo. The component accepts a ratio as a prop. In the Psammead component library, Image Placeholder is used within the [psammead-figure](https://github.com/BBC-News/psammead/tree/latest/packages/components/psammead-figure) component.

## When to use this component

Psammead Image Placeholder is designed to appear as a temporary stand-in to be replaced by an actual image, for example in the case of lazy loading. 

## Accessibility notes

As a `div` with a background image, Psammead Image Placeholder is a presentational element without semantic meaning. As such it does not need to meet colour contrast requirements.
