# Talos

## Can Talos be manually invoked?

Yes, Talos can be invoked manually.

To do so you must navigate to Jenkins and click on the play (run) button, then enter the list of packages you want to bump seperated by commas.

## How to review PRs?

## When a Talos PR gets conflicts how can I rebase/recreate it?

## Does it auto-update itself with the latest branch? If not why not do this on a cron? Why only update Talos PRs and not ALL branches every n hours?

## does Talos handle the package bumping and changelog?

## how does it treat Release Candidate, alpha, beta and v0.X package versions?

## when Psammead is up to date how do I pull changes through to Simorgh?

## I don't see why I wouldn't want to try to update everything, how do I invoke it with \*/ALL packages being updated?

## Short origin (i.e name, why we have it?)

In Greek mythology, Talos, also spelled Talus, was a giant automaton made of bronze to protect Europa in Crete from pirates and invaders.
